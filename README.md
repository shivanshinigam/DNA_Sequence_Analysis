# DNA_Sequence_Analysis

Citing a musical composition as an analogy for DNA sequences, this research is the first to apply Huffman coding to compress genetic data. First, the genetic landscape is revealed by closely examining the frequency of each DNA base symbol. A Huffman tree is then painstakingly built, creating a binary symphony that forms the basis for effective coding. Different Huffman codes are given to every DNA symbol, like notes in a song, creating a unique genetic tune. Like a beautiful metamorphosis, the compression process produces a well-polished binary work and a significant decrease in the amount of data. Together, computing power and biological knowledge are combined to create a harmonious method that not only facilitates seamless storage and transfer but also marks a major advancement in the administration of genetic data.
